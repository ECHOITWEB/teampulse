# TeamPulse Workspace Implementation Plan

## Overview
Implement a Slack-like team-based workspace system for TeamPulse with Firebase Google authentication, project/workspace management, team invitations, role-based access control, and subscription billing.

## Architecture Design

### 1. Authentication Layer (Firebase)
- **Technology**: Firebase Authentication with Google OAuth
- **Components**:
  - Firebase SDK integration (frontend & backend)
  - JWT token validation middleware
  - Session management
  - User profile synchronization

### 2. Workspace Model
- **Core Concepts**:
  - Workspaces = Isolated project environments (like Slack workspaces)
  - Users can belong to multiple workspaces
  - Each workspace has its own teams, channels, goals, tasks
  - Workspace-level billing and subscription

### 3. Database Schema Updates
- New tables: workspaces, workspace_members, workspace_invitations, workspace_billing
- Updated existing tables with workspace_id foreign key
- Audit logging for compliance and security

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Authentication Setup (Backend Expert + Frontend Expert)

#### Backend Tasks:
1. Install Firebase Admin SDK
   ```bash
   npm install firebase-admin
   ```

2. Create Firebase authentication middleware
   - Token verification
   - User session management
   - User profile sync with database

3. Update user controller for Firebase integration
   - Login/signup endpoints
   - Profile update endpoints
   - Token refresh logic

#### Frontend Tasks:
1. Install Firebase SDK
   ```bash
   npm install firebase
   ```

2. Create authentication components:
   - Google login button
   - Authentication context/provider
   - Protected route wrapper
   - User profile component

3. Update App.tsx with authentication flow

### Phase 2: Workspace Management (Backend Expert)

#### API Endpoints:
```
POST   /api/workspaces                 - Create workspace
GET    /api/workspaces                 - List user's workspaces
GET    /api/workspaces/:slug           - Get workspace details
PUT    /api/workspaces/:id             - Update workspace
DELETE /api/workspaces/:id             - Delete workspace (owner only)

POST   /api/workspaces/:id/members     - Invite member
GET    /api/workspaces/:id/members     - List members
PUT    /api/workspaces/:id/members/:userId - Update member role
DELETE /api/workspaces/:id/members/:userId - Remove member

POST   /api/workspaces/:id/invite      - Send email invitation
GET    /api/invitations/:token         - Get invitation details
POST   /api/invitations/:token/accept  - Accept invitation
```

#### Controllers:
1. `workspaceController.js` - Workspace CRUD operations
2. `workspaceMemberController.js` - Member management
3. `invitationController.js` - Invitation handling

### Phase 3: Frontend Workspace UI (Frontend Expert + Design Expert)

#### Components:
1. **Workspace Switcher**
   - Dropdown to switch between workspaces
   - Create new workspace option
   - Current workspace indicator

2. **Workspace Dashboard**
   - Overview stats
   - Recent activity
   - Quick actions

3. **Workspace Settings**
   - General settings
   - Member management
   - Billing information
   - Security settings

4. **Invitation Flow**
   - Invite members form
   - Pending invitations list
   - Accept invitation page

### Phase 4: Role-Based Access Control (Backend Expert)

#### Middleware:
1. `workspaceAuth.js` - Verify workspace membership
2. `roleAuth.js` - Check user permissions
3. `resourceAuth.js` - Validate resource access

#### Permission Matrix:
| Feature | Owner | Admin | Member | Guest |
|---------|-------|-------|--------|-------|
| View workspace | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Edit workspace | ✓ | ✓ | ✗ | ✗ |
| Delete workspace | ✓ | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ |
| Manage billing | ✓ | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ |
| Invite members | ✓ | ✓ | ✗ | ✗ |
| Remove members | ✓ | ✓ | ✗ | ✗ |
| Create projects | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✗ |
| View all data | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | Limited |

### Phase 5: Billing Integration (Backend Expert)

#### Stripe Integration:
1. Install Stripe SDK
   ```bash
   npm install stripe
   ```

2. Create billing endpoints:
   - Create customer
   - Add payment method
   - Create subscription
   - Update subscription
   - Cancel subscription
   - Payment history

3. Webhook handlers:
   - Payment success/failure
   - Subscription updates
   - Invoice generation

### Phase 6: Context Switching (Frontend Expert)

#### Implementation:
1. **Workspace Context Provider**
   ```typescript
   interface WorkspaceContext {
     currentWorkspace: Workspace | null;
     switchWorkspace: (workspaceId: string) => Promise<void>;
     workspaces: Workspace[];
     loading: boolean;
   }
   ```

2. **Update existing features**:
   - Filter all data by current workspace
   - Update API calls to include workspace context
   - Update UI to show workspace-specific data

### Phase 7: Testing & Integration (All Experts)
